    <string name="description_text_welcome">This app aims to protect you from malicious
        Bluetooth Low Energy trackers. It detects when such a tracker is following you.
        Therefore Bluetooth Low Energy needs to be enabled. Also you need to allow the app
        to use your location. This way the app can determine if a tracker is following you.
        Please keep Bluetooth enabled and allow the app to use your location, otherwise the
        app cannot detect malicious trackers.</string>
